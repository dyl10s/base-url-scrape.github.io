# Base URL Crawling
Out of curiosity I wanted a way to see just how connected the web is. 
I build this very simple tool that scrapes base URLs off pages and continues to do this same thing on every page it finds. 
I was quite surprised to see the infinite number of pages I get to by just putting in googles home page. 
The tool is hosted on [here on github pages](http://baseurlscrape.tk/), so anyone is welcome to mess around with it.
